This file provides details of the pyflow instance currently using this data directory.
During normal pyflow run termination (due to job completion, error, SIGINT, etc...),
this file should be deleted. If this file is present it should mean either:
(1) the data directory is still in use by a running workflow
(2) a sudden job failure occured that prevented normal run termination
